//PRELOAD SCRIPT
/*
 * The code below will execute before the main exo window is
 * shown. Here you can execute any preload scripts which may
 * require setup.
 * 
 * If you want to run purely a javascript file, you can do so by
 * calling ExitApp() at the end of this document. This will run
 * the javascript and then close the application before showing
 * the HTML window.
 * 
 * This file is also loaded into the html window, so you can define
 * all your javascript here if wanted.
